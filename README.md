# `#include <collections.h>`

> Easily swap out C++ collection classes

## What?

Nothing fancy.

Just a library which looks at your available `#include` paths and picks an unordered map or set to use.

## Installation

### xmake

#### `xmake.lua`

```lua
add_repositories("MrowrLib https://github.com/MrowrLib/Packages.git")
add_requires("collections")

target("Example")
    add_packages("collections")
    add_packages("unordered_dense") -- some library with cool collections
```

### vcpkg

#### `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
add_executable(Example main.cpp)

# Find string_format and link it to your target
find_package(string_format CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(Example PRIVATE collections::collections)

# If you're using C++20, you won't need fmt
target_compile_features(Example PRIVATE cxx_std_20)

# Else, add 'fmt' as a dependency
find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(Example PRIVATE fmt::fmt)
```

#### `vcpkg.json`

```json
{
    "dependencies": ["mrowr-collections"]
}
```

And if you want to use `unordered-dense` or some other package:

```json
{
    "dependencies": ["mrowr-collections", "unordered-dense"]
}
```

#### `vcpkg-configuration.json`

```json
{
    "default-registry": {
        "kind": "git",
        "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git",
        "baseline": "354a05b99db8bec88347a8d35b46fbe7ef4c16da"
    },
    "registries": [
        {
            "kind": "git",
            "repository": "https://github.com/MrowrLib/Packages.git",
            "baseline": "TODO",
            "packages": ["mrowr-collections"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Why?

I want to be able to simply use a single definition of my unordered map and set types, and have them automatically use the best available library.

I don't want my libraries to require users to use a specific hashtable or set implementation.

With this, you can make a library and the user can choose what collection types they want to use.

## How?

```cpp
#include <collections.h>

int main() {
    // If you have unordered_dense available, this will be an ankerl::unordered_dense::map
    // If you have parallel_hashmap available, this will be a phmap::flat_hash_set
    // If you have robin hood available, this will be a robin_hood::unordered_map
    // If you have boost unordered available, this will be a boost::unordered_map
    // And so on...
    // Else it will fall back to std::unordered_map
    collections_map<int, int> map;

    // If you have unordered_dense available, this will be an ankerl::unordered_dense::set
    // If you have parallel_hashmap available, this will be a phmap::flat_hash_set
    // If you have robin hood available, this will be a robin_hood::unordered_set
    // If you have boost unordered available, this will be a boost::unordered_set
    // And so on...
    // Else it will fall back to std::unordered_set
    collections_set<int> set;
}
```

### Specifying a collection type

The following defines can be set which will force a specific collection type to be used:
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_UNORDERED_DENSE`
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_PHMAP`
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_ROBIN_HOOD`
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_BOOST`
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_TSL`
- `COLLECTIONS_MAP_STD`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_UNORDERED_DENSE`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_PHMAP`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_ROBIN_HOOD`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_BOOST`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_TSL`
- `COLLECTIONS_SET_STD`

> **Why these specific libraries?**
> Well, they just happen to be popular ones which I noticed.
> Happy to add others or change the order of their lookup.
> 
> Benchmarks for many of these libraries can be found here:
> [Comprehensive C++ Hashmap Benchmarks 2022](https://martin.ankerl.com/2022/08/27/hashmap-bench-01/)

### Or define the collection type yourself

If you want to use a collection type which isn't supported by this library, you can define your own collection type:

```cpp
#define collections_map my::awesome::unordered_map

// ^ make sure do do this BEFORE you include <collections.h>
#include <collections.h>
```
